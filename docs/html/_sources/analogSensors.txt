.. module: analogSensor

This module contains class definitions for analog sensors.
AnalogSensor class is a subclass of the generic Sensor class and provides a simple
way to handle sensors sensing quantities that can assume more than two different values.
Every AnalogSensor instance inherits the whole set of methods from generic Sensor class.

    
==================
AnalogSensor class
==================

.. class:: AnalogSensor(pin)

    This is the class for sensing analog quantities

Pin can be both a real board pin and a tuple containing an analog sensor object
and a string for a window parameter to read.
Example::

    lightSensor = AnalogSensor(A4)
    sensorOnAverage = AnalogSensor((lightSensor,'currentAverage'))

the above code instantiates a light sensor on a board pin and another sensor that takes as input the lightSensor average.
