Smart Sensor Pool
============
The smartSensors library is a ready to use set of functions that are very useful for managing analog and digital sensors.
Common operations like calculating min, max, average and trends are completely automated by the smartSensors library.
Moreover the smartSensors lib allows user to define calibration functions for analog sensors and to use callback to schedule sampling and acquisition operations.

This examples shows the basic use of the sensorPool, a module of the library used to create set of heterogeneous sensors to be managed in parallel simplifying the acquisition and calculation routines
